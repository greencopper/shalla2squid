shalla2squid - Convert shallalist format to squid external ACL format.

This is a simple program to convert blacklists from the shallalist format
(http://www.shallalist.de) into a format which can be readily used by
the Squid proxy.

The program is smart enough to remove "path duplications" in the lists.
For example, squid won't like something like this:

  .foo.bar.com
  .moo.bar.com
  .bar.com

Because .bar.com already matches anything under the domain bar.com. Squid
will (sadly) die if these conditions exist in the input files.

The program will also prefix every line in the shalla list with a dot
(squid requires a dot prefix to mean "everything under this domain".)

Usage:
  cat BL/<cat1>/domains BL<cat2>/domains... | shalla2squid >shalla_combined

Inside squid, use:
  acl shalla_combined dstdomain "/etc/squid3/combined"
  http_access deny shalla_combined
